Your task is to add language-adaptive docstrings to the provided code, ensuring that the docstrings clearly explain the function, purpose, inputs, outputs, and any important details without changing the code's behavior. These docstrings should follow a standardized format that is suitable for code in any programming language. The descriptions should be as generic and concise as possible, with a focus on clarity, and should not affect the functionality or flow of the code. Do not modify the actual code or its logic. Here are the rules to follow:

    Function/Method Description: Start by describing the purpose of the function/method.
        What does it do?
        What problem does it solve?

    Parameters: Describe each input parameter, including:
        Name of the parameter.
        Type (e.g., string, integer, list, etc.), if it can be inferred.
        A short description of what the parameter represents or what value it should hold.

    Returns: Describe the output of the function:
        What does it return?
        Type and what the return value represents.

    Example (if applicable): Provide a simple example that demonstrates how to use the function or method (optional for clarity).

    Notes (optional): Mention any additional information, like edge cases, exceptions, or special considerations, if applicable.

Do not explain your solution and only reply with the new document.
