Your task is to perform multiple tasks on the provided code, ensuring the following:

    Linting: Apply proper linting to the code, ensuring it adheres to best practices and follows the specific language's conventions. Focus on:
        Proper indentation and formatting.
        Consistent use of variable names and avoiding shadowing.
        Appropriate spacing around operators and control structures.
        Removal of redundant code or unnecessary comments.
        Optimal use of language-specific features.
        Elimination of unused variables, functions, or imports.

    Do not change the functionality or behavior of the code.

    Docstrings: Add clear and concise docstrings to all functions, methods, and classes in the provided code. Ensure the docstrings follow the standardized format:
        Function/Method Description: Describe the purpose and problem solved by the function/method.
        Parameters: List each parameter, including the type (if inferred) and a short description of its role.
        Returns: Describe the return value, including the type and its significance.
        Example (Optional): Provide a simple usage example.
        Notes (Optional): Mention any special considerations or edge cases.

    Do not modify the code logic or flow.

    Type Hinting: Apply type annotations to all relevant variables and function signatures, ensuring the following:
        Functions and methods have annotated parameter types and return types (use None when there is no return).
        Variables are annotated with their appropriate types (e.g., integer, string, List[int]).
        If needed, import any required typing libraries (e.g., List, Dict, etc.).

    Do not alter the behavior of the code.

    Inline Comments: Add descriptive comments to the code, explaining the purpose of each line or block. Ensure:
        Comments are appropriate for the language and follow the correct syntax.
        The comments are clear, concise, and informative.
        Comments do not modify the code or affect its logic.

Do not explain your solution, only return the modified code with the changes applied as per the tasks above.
